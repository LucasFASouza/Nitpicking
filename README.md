# Nitpicking

Welcome to **Nitpicking**, a labor of love inspired by the trivia game show *Um, Actually*. This project is all about spotting and correcting sneaky errors hidden within sentences about pop culture, science, and general nerd knowledge. It’s not affiliated with the original show or Dropout in any way—just a fan-made homage to the joy of being *technically correct* (the best kind of correct).

## Features
- Play solo, with friends, or in teams.
- Sentences with hidden mistakes for you to identify and correct.
- Open-source and open to contributions—add your own sentences or help improve the project.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- **Database**: [Neon](https://neon.tech) with [Drizzle ORM](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- **Icons**: [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com)
- **Deployment**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

## How to Play
Each round presents a sentence about nerdy topics like pop culture or science. While the sentence might seem correct at first glance, there's always one sneaky error hiding in plain sight. Your task is to find it.

- **Solo Play**: Carefully read the sentence, and when you think you've found the mistake, click the eye icon to reveal the actual error. Compare your guess with the correction and give a thumbs up to sentences you enjoyed.
- **Multiplayer**: Play with friends by assigning a host, who reads sentences aloud. Other players interrupt when they think they've found the mistake, and points are awarded for correctly identifying and fixing errors. Detailed rules are available on the [How to Play](#) page.

## Open Source Contributions
